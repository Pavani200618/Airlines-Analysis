# Airlines Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes airline flight data to extract insights on delays, routes, and performance trends. The analysis is performed using Python, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

The goal of this project is to:  
- Understand flight delay patterns by airline  
- Identify most frequent routes  
- Analyze monthly and seasonal trends  
- Provide visual insights for better decision-making
